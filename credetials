Help on Credentials in module google.auth.compute_engine.credentials object:

class CCrreeddeennttiiaallss(google.auth.credentials.Scoped, google.auth.credentials.Credentials)
 |  Compute Engine Credentials.
 |  
 |  These credentials use the Google Compute Engine metadata server to obtain
 |  OAuth 2.0 access tokens associated with the instance's service account.
 |  
 |  For more information about Compute Engine authentication, including how
 |  to configure scopes, see the `Compute Engine authentication
 |  documentation`_.
 |  
 |  .. note:: Compute Engine instances can be created with scopes and therefore
 |      these credentials are considered to be 'scoped'. However, you can
 |      not use :meth:`~google.auth.credentials.ScopedCredentials.with_scopes`
 |      because it is not possible to change the scopes that the instance
 |      has. Also note that
 |      :meth:`~google.auth.credentials.ScopedCredentials.has_scopes` will not
 |      work until the credentials have been refreshed.

 |  ____iinniitt____(self, service_account_email='default')
 |      Args:
 |          service_account_email (str): The service account email to use, or
 |              'default'. A Compute Engine instance may have multiple service
 |              accounts.
 |  
 |  rreeffrreesshh(self, request)
 |      Refresh the access token and scopes.
 |      
 |      Args:
 |          request (google.auth.transport.Request): The object used to make
 |              HTTP requests.
 |      
 |      Raises:
 |          google.auth.exceptions.RefreshError: If the Compute Engine metadata
 |              service can't be reached if if the instance has not
 |              credentials.
 |  
 |  wwiitthh__ssccooppeess(self, scopes)
 |      Unavailable, Compute Engine credentials can not be scoped.
 |      
 |      Scopes can only be set at Compute Engine instance creation time.
 |      See the `Compute Engine authentication documentation`_ for details on
 |      how to configure instance scopes.

 |  aappppllyy(self, headers, token=None)
 |      Apply the token to the authentication header.
 |      
 |      Args:
 |          headers (Mapping): The HTTP request headers.
 |          token (Optional[str]): If specified, overrides the current access

 |      Performs credential-specific before request logic.
 |      
 |      Refreshes the credentials if necessary, then calls :meth:`apply` to
 |      apply the token to the authentication header.
 |      
 |      Args:
 |          request (google.auth.transport.Request): The object used to make
 |              HTTP requests.
 |          method (str): The request's HTTP method or the RPC method being
 |              invoked.

 |  eexxppiirreedd
 |      Checks if the credentials are expired.
 |      
 |      Note that credentials can be invalid but not expired becaue Credentials
 |      with :attr:`expiry` set to None is considered to never expire.
 |  
 |  vvaalliidd
 |      Checks the validity of the credentials.
 |      
 |      This is True if the credentials have a :attr:`token` and the token
 |      is not :attr:`expired`.
